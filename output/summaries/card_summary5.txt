Translation:  
"But that ignorance of those who have not conquered their own selves—their knowledge, like a lamp in a covered pot, merely illumines that (limited) reality."  

Summary:  
This verse highlights that true wisdom comes only to those who have mastered their inner selves. Without self-control, one's knowledge remains superficial—like a lamp hidden inside a pot—unable to reveal deeper truths.
