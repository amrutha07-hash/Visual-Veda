**Translation:**  
"You have the right to perform your actions, but never to the fruits of those actions. 
Do not be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to inaction."  

**Summary:**  
This verse from the *Bhagavad Gita* teaches the principle of selfless action (Karma Yoga). 
It advises focusing on one's duty without attachment to success or failure, emphasizing that true fulfillment comes from doing what is right rather than chasing rewards. Detachment from outcomes prevents greed, anxiety, and discouragement.  

*(Key Message: Act with dedication, but let go of expectations.)*
