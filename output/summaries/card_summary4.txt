**Translation:**  
"Treat happiness and sorrow, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike. Then engage in battle—you will not incur sin."  
— *Shrimad Bhagavad Gita*  

**Summary:**  
This verse advises maintaining equanimity in all circumstances—whether facing joy or sorrow, profit or loss, success or failure. By cultivating this balanced mindset before acting (here, engaging in battle), one avoids the karmic burden of wrongdoing. The message emphasizes detachment from outcomes while fulfilling one's duty.  

*(Context: Lord Krishna’s counsel to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, advocating righteous action without attachment to results.)*
